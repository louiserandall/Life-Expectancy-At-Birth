# Life-Expectancy-At-Birth

I used Excel and SQL for this Analysis

Create a SQL Database for Life expectancy data set and uploaded CSV files which I cleaned in Excel to remove duplicates and null values.  

During my analysis I ran queries and made the following changes:

- Altered location data type in SQL from text to NVARCHAR to enable sorting  
- Joined both Hale and life Expectancy tables together
- Created Subqueries within Outer Queries

I created summeries for the following:

a. Total count of Male, Female per year
b. Total count of Male, Female per location
c. Average of Hale and Life Expectancy per location
d. Average of Male, Female location of Life Expentancy at Birth
e. Lowest locations of Male, female Life Expectancy at Birth less than 50
f. Highest locations of Male, female Life Expectancy at Birth greater than 50
g. Highest % increase location of Male, female Life Expectancy at Birth
h. Total count of Male, Female of Hale WHO region Life Expectancy at Birth per year
i. Total count of Male, Female of Hale WHO region Life Expectancy at Birth per location
j. Average of Male, Female of Hale WHO region Life Expectancy at Birth per location
k. Lowest region of Male, Female of Hale WHO Life Expectancy at Birth 
l. Highest region of Male, female of Hale WHO Life Expectancy at Birth
m. Highest % region of Male, female of Hale WHO Life Expectancy at Birth
